        <p>My favorite character is Cat Valentine who was played by Ariana Grande (my favorite singer). Ariana Grande acted as Cat Valentine in 2 shows called 'Victorious' and 'Sam and Cat'. I like this character because the character is someone who is childish, so dumb and random but REALLY funny. She is one of the best characters in the shows. And even the though both the shows came out around 7-10 years ago, it is one of my topmost favorite shows and she is my most favorite character. </p>
